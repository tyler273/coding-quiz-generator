# CODING QUIZ GENERATOR

## Description

The goal of this project was to create an application that would generate a timed coding quiz that users may utilize to test their knowledge of Javascript. Upon clicking start game the user is shown the first question and a timer begins counting down. Correct answers will guarantee the user points and incorrect answers will cause the timer to drop faster. Their score is able to be saved to local storage at the end by inputting the user's initials.

I was able to complete this assignment and properly code statements with the help of my tutor Katie Redford and the aid of ChatGPT.
